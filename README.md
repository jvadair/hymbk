# hymbk
hymbk is a simple program for keeping track of which hymns you have printed from a digital hymnbook. It was created to save me (jvadair) some time and paper, and shared because I know a few people who may find it useful.

### Compatibility
It is designed and tested only for Linux-based systems, but will likely work on Windows & Mac if you create a .config folder in your home folder, wherever that may be (should be C:\Users\yourname for Windows users).
